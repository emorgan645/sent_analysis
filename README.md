"# sent_analysis" 
"""
Today depression is a leading cause of mental illness worldwide effecting more than 264 million people. It is a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease and can even lead to suicide. This project aims to assist those who display possible signs of persistent depression via their online presence on Twitter. Twitter is a constantly growing platform where the possibility to remain anonymous has allowed users to express and share their feelings around the world without feeling judged. Legitimate checking can help in the discovery of signs of depression, which could be useful to anticipate and prevent depression altogether. Hence the need for an application which can effectively use natural language processing and sentiment analysis to calculate sentiment scores accurately based off different emotions expressed by users in their Tweets. Through this process, it is the aim to provide a function that charities, health services or social media companies can utilise to better understand depression levels in different users and use that information to further aid users who may be suffering from depression.
